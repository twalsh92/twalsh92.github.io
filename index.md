## Welcome

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Sheffield](http://shef.ac.uk), a member of the [Testing Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/testing/home), researching novel methods for quality assurance of responsive web pages.

### About Me

#### Education

I graduated with a First Class Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, during which I developed advanced skills in software development, testing, project and team management.

#### Employment

I currently work as a teaching assistant, helping undergraduate students in laboratory sessions and answering any other questions they may have. Also, between my second and third years of my undergraduate degree, I completed an 8-week software testing internship at a London based tech-startup, which allows me to hone my testing skills, while I've also completed a couple of freelance web development projects.

#### Interests

Outside of the laboratory, I'm a big fan of cycling and running as means of staying healthy. When it comes to relaxing, I am an avid fan of literature and music, and I'm in the process of building up extensive book and vinyl record collections.

Due to the exponential increase in the number of mobile devices being used to access the World Wide Web, it is crucial that web sites are functional and user-friendly across a wide range of web-enabled devices. This necessity has resulted in the introduction of responsive web design (RWD), which uses complex cascading style sheets (CSS) to fluidly modify a web siteâ€™s appearance depending on the viewport width of the device in use. Although existing tools may support the testing of responsive web sites, they are time consuming and error-prone to use because they require manual screenshot inspection at specified viewport widths. Addressing these concerns, this paper presents a method that can automatically detect potential layout faults in responsively designed web sites. To experimentally evaluate this approach, we implemented it as a tool, called REDECHECK, and applied it to 5 real-world web sites that vary in both their approach to responsive design and their complexity. The experiments reveal that REDECHECK finds 91% of the inserted layout faults.
