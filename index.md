# Welcome

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Sheffield](http://shef.ac.uk), a member of the [Testing Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/testing/home), researching novel methods for quality assurance of responsive web pages.

## About Me

I graduated with a First Class Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, during which I developed advanced skills in software development, testing, project and team management. Before that, I studied at Winstanley College where I obtained A-grade A levels in Computing, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics.

### Employment

#### Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Sheffield - September 2014 - Present
Responsible for assisting undergraduate students during weekly lab classes, helping solve technical issues and answering any questions they may have. I have also had the opportunity to lead certain lab classes and to work alongside lecturers in the planning of future lab classes.

#### Software Testing and Development Intern, SkillFlick - July 2013 - September 2013
Worked primarily as a Ruby on Rails software tester, developing a fully automated acceptance test suite for the application using popular technologies such as Cucumber. Also undertook some regular Ruby on Rails development work for a smaller companion tool for the site which handled the booking of photoshoots for users of the site.

### Interests

Outside of the laboratory, I'm a big fitness fan and like to run or get out on my bike whenever I can. When it comes to relaxing, I am an avid fan of literature and music, and I'm in the process of building up extensive book and vinyl record collections.
