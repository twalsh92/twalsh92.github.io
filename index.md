# Welcome
I'm a software engineer at [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com/), working to deliver ingeniously simple tools for professionals working on the Microsoft Data Platform. Before that, I was a PhD student at the [University of Sheffield](http://shef.ac.uk), where as a member of the [Testing Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/testing/home) I researched novel methods for quality assurance of responsive web pages.

## About Me

I graduated with a First Class Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, during which I developed advanced skills in software development, testing, project and team management. Before that, I studied at Winstanley College where I obtained A-grade A levels in Computing, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics.

### Employment

#### Software Engineer, Redgate Software - April 2018 - Present
I work as part of a cross-functional team responsible for SQL Prompt, one of the leading productivity tools for data specialists working on the Microsoft SQL Server data platform.

#### Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Sheffield - September 2014 - December 2017
Responsible for assisting undergraduate students during weekly lab classes, helping solve technical issues and answering any questions they may have. I have also had the opportunity to lead certain lab classes and to work alongside lecturers in the planning of future lab classes.

#### Software Testing and Development Intern, SkillFlick - July 2013 - September 2013
Worked primarily as a Ruby on Rails software tester, developing a fully automated acceptance test suite for the application using popular technologies such as Cucumber. Also undertook some regular Ruby on Rails development work for a smaller companion tool for the site which handled the booking of photoshoots for users of the site.

### Interests

Outside of work, I'm a big fitness fan and like to run or get out on my bike whenever I can. When it comes to relaxing, I am an avid fan of literature and music, so you'll frequently find me with my head stuck in a good book or listening to some vinyl.
