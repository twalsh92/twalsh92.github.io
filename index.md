# Welcome

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Sheffield](http://shef.ac.uk), a member of the [Testing Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/testing/home), researching novel methods for quality assurance of responsive web pages.

## About Me

### Education

I graduated with a First Class Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2014, during which I developed advanced skills in software development, testing, project and team management. Before that, I studied at Winstanley College where I obtained A-grade A levels in Computing, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics.

### Employment

#### Graduate Teaching Assistant
##### University of Sheffield
##### September 2014 - Present
Responsible for assisting undergraduate students during weekly lab classes, helping solve technical issues and answering any questions they may have. I have also had the opportunity to lead certain lab classes and to work alongside lecturers in the planning of future lab classes.

#### Software Testing and Development Intern
##### SkillFlick
###### July 2013 - September 2013
Worked primarily as a Ruby on Rails software tester, developing a fully automated acceptance test suite for the application using popular technologies such as Cucumber. Also undertook some regular Ruby on Rails development work for a smaller companion tool for the site which handled the booking of photoshoots for users of the site.

### Interests

Outside of the laboratory, I'm a big fitness fan and like to run or get out on my bike whenever I can. When it comes to relaxing, I am an avid fan of literature and music, and I'm in the process of building up extensive book and vinyl record collections.

Due to the exponential increase in the number of mobile devices being used to access the World Wide Web, it is crucial that web sites are functional and user-friendly across a wide range of web-enabled devices. This necessity has resulted in the introduction of responsive web design (RWD), which uses complex cascading style sheets (CSS) to fluidly modify a web siteâ€™s appearance depending on the viewport width of the device in use. Although existing tools may support the testing of responsive web sites, they are time consuming and error-prone to use because they require manual screenshot inspection at specified viewport widths. Addressing these concerns, this paper presents a method that can automatically detect potential layout faults in responsively designed web sites. To experimentally evaluate this approach, we implemented it as a tool, called REDECHECK, and applied it to 5 real-world web sites that vary in both their approach to responsive design and their complexity. The experiments reveal that REDECHECK finds 91% of the inserted layout faults.
